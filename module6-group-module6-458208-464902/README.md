- When a user creates a new username to sign in, and happen to enter a username that is already taken, they are prompted to enter a new one. If they successfully enter a new username that is different from the usernames already taken, they are signed in normally. If they enter the same username that was previously entered, a function runs that appends random integers to the end of this username until it is unique. At this point, the user is signed in.  
- When a user sends a message, the contents of the message are passed through a filter to prevent profanity in the chat room. If the user includes the F-word or the S-word in their messages, these words are converted to a safe version.
- When a user presses the input box to begin typing a message, a message is broadcasted to other users of the same room indicating that this specific user is typing. This is indicated by a message being sent from the user with "..." as its contents.
